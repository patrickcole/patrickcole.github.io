    <h2>Using JSON With Localstorage</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Remember that JSON has to be formatted before it can be saved and properly parsed when retrieved. These gotchas can hurt if you are working with JavaScript objects and are expecting them to be native objects from the start.
When saving JSON data to storage, make sure that you are calling the JSON.stringify() method on your object either before or during the localStorage.setItem(&#39;key&#39;, value) call. What this ensures is that the value will be a properly formatted JSON string and will retain its relationship data and values....</p>

    <h2>Be Careful With Env Files</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Oh they are soo nice to work with aren’t they? Until you realize that you accidentally uploaded one to your public repository. That’s what I accidentally did today. Fortunately, I caught it early on so that I didn’t have any issues with my database that I’m using.
I have learned from this that I really need to think ahead with dealing with environment variables. Simply placing them in as an afterthought or during prototyping is not a great idea....</p>

    <h2>react-youtube</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>I just wanted to post a quick article on this new dependency I found recently. The react-youtube module is very useful for getting an embedded YouTube video inside your applications. I found the installation and configuration of the module to be very easy.
It’s also important to note that this module will work with the YouTube IFrame Player API and has links to the documentation for configuration. I have implemented a copy of this module inside my latest project react-OST where I am using the player for embedding soundtrack videos that have been uploaded....</p>

   <p>Contents  Pages Resources  Pages Preloading a page tells the browser that the user is definitely going to visit a page and the browser should get that page ready to load immediately.
For example, an application has an intro screen to describe what the application is about. Once users accept entry into the application, the logical next page they would visit would be the home or main page. Ideally, users would want that page to load as quickly as possible....</p>
