      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Front-End Engineer who is driven to learn, create and explore with the web. My love for technology, art and science provide inspiration and creativity to my endeavors.
My first computer was an Atari ST and some of my earliest and favorite memories are punching away on the keyboard while learning my first letters and words. I treasure the moments spent learning how this wonderful piece of circuitry and software came together.</description>
