  <div class="post-content"><p>This is just the start of my findings, notes and examples. I hope that I can use this platform to show my progression of learning things. It will also be helpful for me as I try to pull together all those topics that make up the web. I will do my best to try to keep things updated, but as we know, the web moves very quickly. Also, it is my intention to keep topics organized so that when I need to locate something for research, reference or discussion, I will have it at the ready.</p>

<p>My writings on here are by no means final and could potentially change over time. My intention is to keep all notes, even inaccurate or out-of-date, so that you can see the progression of my comprehension. By keeping this as a journal format rather than a definitive format, I can show my thinking and perhaps it could help someone else with their issues. Anything that is expired or corrected, will be marked and the update or solution will be provided underneath.</p>

<p>Even as I write this first post, I&rsquo;m learning about how to integrate Markdown with Hugo. I&rsquo;m sure there are things I&rsquo;m doing right now that I will correct in the future. That&rsquo;s what makes this interesting to me is that I&rsquo;ll be able to look back and see what I did in this post and learn from it.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and once again, these posts are not meant to be definitive, but rather a &ldquo;status update&rdquo; of where I am with certain topics so please bear with me.</p>
