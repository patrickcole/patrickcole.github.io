    <h2>Be Careful With Env Files</h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>Oh they are soo nice to work with aren’t they? Until you realize that you accidentally uploaded one to your public repository. That’s what I accidentally did today. Fortunately, I caught it early on so that I didn’t have any issues with my database that I’m using.
I have learned from this that I really need to think ahead with dealing with environment variables. Simply placing them in as an afterthought or during prototyping is not a great idea....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
   <p>This is just the start of my findings, notes and examples. I hope that I can use this platform to show my progression of learning things. It will also be helpful for me as I try to pull together all those topics that make up the web. I will do my best to try to keep things updated, but as we know, the web moves very quickly. Also, it is my intention to keep topics organized so that when I need to locate something for research, reference or discussion, I will have it at the ready....</p>
