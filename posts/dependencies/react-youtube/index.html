It&rsquo;s also important to note that this module will work with the YouTube IFrame Player API and has links to the documentation for configuration.

  <div class="post-content"><p>I just wanted to post a quick article on this new dependency I found recently. The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-youtube">react-youtube</a> module is very useful for getting an embedded YouTube video inside your applications. I found the installation and configuration of the module to be very easy.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also important to note that this module will work with the YouTube IFrame Player API and has links to the documentation for configuration. I have implemented a copy of this module inside my latest project <a href="https://github.com/patrickcole/react-ost">react-OST</a> where I am using the player for embedding soundtrack videos that have been uploaded.</p>

<p>Through trial and error, I was able to get my application to connect to the player and controlling the video based on various commands I would issue. Commands such as play, pause and seekTo all worked. If you are in the need of a quick YouTube player, I would recommend using this dependency.</p>
