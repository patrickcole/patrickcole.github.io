      <description>I just wanted to post a quick article on this new dependency I found recently. The react-youtube module is very useful for getting an embedded YouTube video inside your applications. I found the installation and configuration of the module to be very easy.
It&amp;rsquo;s also important to note that this module will work with the YouTube IFrame Player API and has links to the documentation for configuration. I have implemented a copy of this module inside my latest project react-OST where I am using the player for embedding soundtrack videos that have been uploaded.</description>

      <description>This is just the start of my findings, notes and examples. I hope that I can use this platform to show my progression of learning things. It will also be helpful for me as I try to pull together all those topics that make up the web. I will do my best to try to keep things updated, but as we know, the web moves very quickly. Also, it is my intention to keep topics organized so that when I need to locate something for research, reference or discussion, I will have it at the ready.</description>
