<p>I have learned from this that I really need to think ahead with dealing with environment variables. Simply placing them in as an afterthought or during prototyping is not a great idea. Have the mindset from the beginning of your repo that you will probably need to use environment variables. Make an effort to ignore them up-front in your .gitignore file. That will save you some embarrassment later. However, if you do find yourself needing to quickly address this, here&rsquo;s a <code>git</code> command that I found very useful:</p>

<pre><code>git rm -f .env
</code></pre>

<p>Do this in addition to adding the file to your .gitignore file so that it ensures that it will never try to track the .env file. Hopefully, this gives you a great lesson on how to keep your variables private in the future.</p>
